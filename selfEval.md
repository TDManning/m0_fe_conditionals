# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel fairly comfortable with comparison operators. They simply compare values of the same data type and render a true or false. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I'm comfortable with the logical operators && and ||. I had never noticed the pipe character on the keyboard prior to Conditionals and had to use google to identify it. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

If statements are fairly straightforward but it still takes me time to put together a long string of if/else if/else statements with correct symbols { } and () in the correct places. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I had some challenges using VS Code and getting the technology to work so although I felt comfortable with the topic after 1.5 hours of review, I spend most of the day trying to figure out the assignment compeltion and submission portion.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I haven't had a chance to practice interpolation much and would like more practice with that this upcoming week. Additionally, I did not complete the section titled "More Practice: Logical Operators with Conditions," becuase it was confusing, so I would like to circle back to this part to see if I can figure it out. 

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

See directly above "More practice..." I might see if any peers have completed it and how they set it up.
